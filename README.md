# Shooping Cart
This is a assignment to add item from `div`  to another `div`. The content are updated using *DOM (Document Object Model)*. To add item into the product list `fetch()` is being used and the `data.json` contains products name, price, imgUrl.  
BootStrap has been used to work faster and some responsiveness.
